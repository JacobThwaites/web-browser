# Web Browser

A barebones web browser, built from the ground up using Go and JavaScript.

The philosophy of this project is to build as much as possible from scratch, rather than relying on existing libraries. This means implementing:

- HTML Parsing and rendering
- TLS Handshakes
- HTTP Requests
- DNS Lookup
- CSS (Maybe one day)
